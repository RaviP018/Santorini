You start the game at the main(). main() calls reset() which reset’s the values of all variables to the original value. Then we call playGame(). In playGame() we call reset() again and then call choosePosition(). choosePosition() asks the user to input an X and Y value by calling chooseX() and chooseY() as long as they are between 0-5. Then we print the gameBoard and set the values of the Ai’s position. Then we check the Board to make sure there are <10 0’s and 4’s on the gameBoard. While there are <10 0’s and 4’s, we make the player move by calling the makePlayerMove() function. In the function we just recall the choosePosition() again to rechoose the player’s position. Then call the addPlayerMove() function in order to add +1 to all the spots vertically, horizontally, and diagonally from the player’s position, as long as it isn’t on the Ai’s position. Then we check to make sure there are <10 0’s and 4’s on the board, if there are more than 10 then we break out of the while loop. Otherwise we make the Ai move by calling the makeAiMove() function. We do that by checking all the adjacent values of the Ai by calling the “check” method that will return a value. We check to see which value is the highest and move to the spot with the highest value. When we make the move, we call addAiMove() in order to -1 to all the spots vertically, horizontally, and diagonally. And repeat this while method, while there <10 0’s and 4’s. Once the Game ends, you get the option to play again if you press 1, or to stop if you press any other number.
